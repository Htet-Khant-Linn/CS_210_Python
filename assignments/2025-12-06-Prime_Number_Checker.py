3. A positive whole number n > 2 is prime if no number between 2 and n evenly divides n. 
Write a program that accepts a value of n as input and determines if the value is prime. 
If n is not prime, your program should quit as soon as it finds a value that evenly divides n. 
Hints: 
import math
for loop
if … else
