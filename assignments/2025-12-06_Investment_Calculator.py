2. Write a program that uses a while loop to determine 
how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. 
The input will be an annualized interest rate,
 and the output is the number of years it takes an investment to double. 
 Note: The amount of the initial investment does not matter; you can use $1.  
Hints: 
Start with an initial investment of $1. Each year, 
increase the current value of the investment by multiplying it by the interest rate 
(converted to decimal) and adding it to the current amount. 
Use a while loop to keep doing this until the amount reaches $2. 
Count how many years it takes.
