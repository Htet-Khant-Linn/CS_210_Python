1. The Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .. 
Each number in the sequence (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two. 
Write a program that computes and outputs the nth Fibonacci number, 
where n is a value entered by the user. 
Hints:
if … else
Use a while loop to add the two previous Fibonacci numbers, 
starting with 1 and 1, and repeat this process until you reach the nth number.
Keep track of the two most recent values as you go.
